<h1>Create Lab Environment Running Actve Directory</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I created two virtual machines to serve as my lab environment. The first machine was runnning Windows Server 2019. This allowed me to create a Virtual Local Area Network. I set up  Actice Directory and other services to run on this machine. I also used Powershell to create a list of users in AD. The second machine was set up running Windows 10 Pro. This was confgured as a client and tied into the network through the server.
